# Rossmann Stores - Sales Prediction
Dirk Rossmann GmbH (usual: Rossmann) is one of the largest drug store chains in Europe with around 56,200 employees and more than 4000 stores across Europe. In 2019 Rossmann had more than â‚¬10 billion turnover in Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Albania, Kosovo and Spain.

## Problem
Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

## Solution
In this notebook follows a proposed solution to the question, where through a Telegram bot, the user presents the store number as input and the bot responds with the total sales expected for the store at the end of the following six weeks.
